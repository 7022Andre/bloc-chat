## BlocChat AngularJS

The goal was to create a chat application that sends and receives messages in realtime using AngularJS on the front-end and Google Firebase on the back-end. THe project also deepened my knowledge and understanding of HTML and CSS. I enjoyed this project a lot, especially the interaction with Firebaseâ€™s API.
